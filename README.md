Minimalist version of the log recorder. A basic program which allows you to write into a designated text file with timestamps.

[Default Linux version](https://github.com/kittenparry/effective-chainsaw/tree/linux-test)

[Default Windows version](https://github.com/kittenparry/effective-chainsaw)

You need to enter file location and file name beforehand for the program to work for your needs. Default file path is `C:\Users\Public\someFile.txt`.

`effective-chainsaw` is a repository name GitHub randomly suggested, it has nothing to do with the program itself.
