# Log Recorder
It's a log recorder of sorts I have written two years ago (July 3 2014). I will update it and maybe look for errors when I feel like it.

[Linux version](https://github.com/kittenparry/effective-chainsaw/tree/linux-test)

Currently the program is set to output logs into `C:\someFile.txt`. You can change it to your liking. Unlike the Linux version, in Windows version you can put the .jar file anywhere you want and it would still work properly, eg. you can write to `C:\output\test.txt` from your desktop. You also don't need to write the whole path if the .jar file is in a parent directory. Say the .jar file is located in `C:\test\`, you would only put `output` into `txt1` text field and you could easily write to the file `C:\test\output\records.txt`.

`effective-chainsaw` is a repository name GitHub randomly suggested, it has nothing to do with the program itself.
