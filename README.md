# Log Recorder
It's a log recorder of sorts I have written two years ago (July 3 2014). I will update it and maybe look for errors when I feel like it.

As I understand from my experience Linux deals with folders in a different way than Windows does, of course I could be wrong or I, myself don't have the correct understanding of them. I have a modified version of the code for Linux. I may put that here, too. In that version I have also the line of code where it focuses to the entry text field automatically (eg. JTextField `txt2`) as the program launches.

`effective-chainsaw` is a repository name GitHub randomly suggested, it has nothing to do with the program itself.
