# Log Recorder
A basic program which allows you to write into a designated text file with timestamps.

I couldn't make it work in another folder other than the `Home` directory (**It only works if the .jar file is put in the `Home` directory**). You need to enter file location and file name beforehand for the program to work for your needs. Default file path is `Home/Dropbox/someFile.txt`. You can also enable editing of the directory and filename fields if need be.

`effective-chainsaw` is a repository name GitHub randomly suggested, it has nothing to do with the program itself.
