# Log Recorder
It's a log recorder of sorts I have written two years ago (July 3 2014). I will update it and maybe look for errors when I feel like it.

As I understand from my experience Linux deals with folders in a different way than Windows does, of course I could be wrong or I, myself don't have the correct understanding of them. This is the modified version for the Linux. I didn't have the source code so I gathered the changes from a decompiler, **I am yet to test if it's working properly**.

From the previous version working version in Linux, I couldn't make it work in another folder other than `Home` directory. Currently it's set to record logs into `Home/Dropbox/myLogs.txt`. You can change the folder (`txt1`) and filename (`txt3`) to your liking.

`effective-chainsaw` is a repository name GitHub randomly suggested, it has nothing to do with the program itself.
