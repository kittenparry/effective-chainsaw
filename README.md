A basic program which allows you to write into a designated text file with timestamps.

You need to enter file location and file name beforehand for the program to work for your needs. Default file path is `C:\Users\Public\someFile.txt`. You can also enable editing of the directory and filename fields if need be.

`effective-chainsaw` is a repository name GitHub randomly suggested, it has nothing to do with the program itself.
